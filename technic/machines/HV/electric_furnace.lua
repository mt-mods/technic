-- MV Electric Furnace
-- This is a faster version of the stone furnace which runs on EUs
-- In addition to this it can be upgraded with microcontrollers and batteries
-- This new version uses the batteries to lower the power consumption of the machine
-- Also in addition this furnace can be attached to the pipe system from the pipeworks mod.

-- FIXME: kpoppel I'd like to introduce an induction heating element here also
