# Overview

<img src="./technic/doc/images/Technic Screenshot.png"/>

The technic modpack extends the Minetest game with many new elements,
mainly constructable machines and tools.  It is a large modpack, and
tends to dominate gameplay when it is used.  This manual describes how
to use the technic modpack, mainly from a player's perspective.

The technic modpack depends on some other modpacks:

* the basic Minetest game
* mesecons, which supports the construction of logic systems based on
  signalling elements
* pipeworks, which supports the automation of item transport
* moreores, which provides some additional ore types
* basic_materials, which provides some basic craft items

This manual doesn't explain how to use these other modpacks, which have
their own manuals:

* [Minetest Game Documentation](https://wiki.minetest.net/Main_Page)
* [Mesecons Documentation](http://mesecons.net/items.html)
* [Pipeworks Documentation](https://gitlab.com/VanessaE/pipeworks/-/wikis/home)
* [Moreores Forum Post](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=549)
* [Basic materials Repository](https://gitlab.com/VanessaE/basic_materials)

Recipes for constructable items in technic are generally not guessable,
and are also not specifically documented here.  You should use a
craft guide mod to look up the recipes in-game.  For the best possible
guidance, use the unified\_inventory mod, with which technic registers
its specialised recipe types.
